Project: Predicting House Prices Using Random Forest
1.	Project Overview: This project predicts house prices using the "Boston Housing Dataset". A Random Forest Regressor is trained to estimate house prices based on various features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and proximity to the Charles River.
2.	Dataset: Dataset: Boston Housing Dataset Target: Median house price Source: OpenML
3.	Objective: Train a Random Forest model to predict house prices and evaluate the model using the R² score.
4.	Steps: (a) Preprocessing: Standardizing numerical features. (b) Visualization: Comparing price distribution across categories (e.g., Charles River proximity) using boxplots. (c) Modeling: Training a Random Forest Regressor and evaluation using the R² score.
